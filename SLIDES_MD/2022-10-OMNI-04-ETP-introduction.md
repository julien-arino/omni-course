# <!--fit-->Common features in ETP

# <!--fit-->A wide variety of diseases and pathogens

Characteristic is that the pathogens replicate or survive in an abiotic environment

- Enteric diseases
- Food-borne diseases

Important to define precisely what it is we mean by ETP, since the *environment* can be taken to mean anything outside the body, allowing most pathogens to fall into this class

See, e.g., the US CDC [Division of Foodborne, Waterborne, and Environmental Diseases](https://www.cdc.gov/ncezid/dfwed/index.html)

---

# Enteric diseases

Group of diseases associated with the ingestion of food or water contaminated by microorganisms and microbial toxins that attack the gastrointestinal tract

From chatGPT:
> An enteric disease is an illness that affects the digestive system, specifically the intestines. Enteric diseases can be caused by a variety of factors, including viral, bacterial, or parasitic infections, as well as toxins or other harmful substances. These diseases can result in a range of symptoms, including stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and fever

# The "celebrated" fecal-oral route ;)

Cannot remember who I heard using the expression originally... Joke aside, a common dissemination route for ETP

# Fomites

An inanimate object that can transfer a pathogen to a new host after being contaminated or exposed to the pathogen

- Extremely important in hospital settings
- Elevator buttons and door knobs of SARS-CoV-1

# Another common theme - AMR

> Antimicrobial resistance occurs when microorganisms (such as bacteria, fungi, viruses, and parasites) develop the ability to survive exposure to antimicrobial drugs (such as antibiotics, antifungals, antivirals, and antimalarials). This means that the drugs that were previously effective at killing the microorganisms or preventing their growth no longer work, and the infections they cause can become difficult or even impossible to treat. Antimicrobial resistance can lead to longer-lasting and more severe infections, and it can spread to other people. It is a major public health concern, and efforts are underway to address it.
