\begin{frame}{Why?}
    Yes, why, really, must I tell you about this ?
    \vfill
    I model the spread of infectious diseases and, less frequently, more general interactions between species (mathematical ecology)
    \vfill
    I have even modelled how filaments grow (assemble) in cells
    \vfill
    But ``modelling livestock'' ? Nope, never
    \vfill
    So let's take a (for the most part uninformed) dive in models of livestock
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Wait..}
    Digging through the literature, there's actually quite a lot and some of it is quite fun!
    \vfill
    This will be a completely non-exhaustive and random review of some models I have found \textbf{excluding} anything infectious disease related
